## 🔥 Inspiration  
Proteins are the building blocks of life — but understanding their complex structures remains a challenge.

- Most tools for molecular visualization are outdated, unintuitive, or overly technical.  
- Scientists and students alike face a steep learning curve just to view and interpret structural data.  
- We built **Structra** to change that — making professional-grade protein visualization accessible, effortless, and modern.  

> **Our mission:** To transform complex molecular data into interactive, intuitive experiences for everyone.
